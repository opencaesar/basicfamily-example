# basicfamily-example
An [OML](https://www.opencaesar.io/oml/) example featuring a Sirius viewpoint for a `basicfamily` domain. It is inspired from a [similar example](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Sirius/Tutorials/StarterTutorial) where the vocabulary has been modeled in [Ecore](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Sirius/Tutorials/DomainModelTutorial).
